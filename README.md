# Dedalus-Channelflow Comparison Project
We are benchmarking and testing Dedalus against the venerable [Channelflow](http://channelflow.org/). 

## Goals
### Speed comparison
How fast is Dedalus compared to a tight, optimized C++ code?
### Accuracy
Can we reproduce non-linear equilibrium solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in plane Couette flow?
